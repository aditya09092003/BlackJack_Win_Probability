# BlackJack_Win_Probability
In this project, we have caluculated the probability of winning the card game called "BLACK JACK". 
In the first case, if the dealer's card is shown, we can find the probability of we winning the game. 
In the second test case, when dealers card is shown and we have two cards showing to all the players, now, 
if we chose "hit" --> what is the probability of winning the game. or, if we chose "stand" --> what is the probability of winning the game.
